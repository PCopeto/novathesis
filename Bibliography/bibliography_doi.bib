	abstract = {Quasi-free scattering of atomic nuclei away from the stability line has reached several milestones over the past decade. The advent of gamma, charged-particle, and neutron detection devices for inverse kinematics, especially in combination with RI beams, has opened new horizons in nuclear physics. Research is progressing with detection devices optimized to explore these new and challenging areas of physics. While some of the new detection developments aim for high energy and angular resolution, others focus on increasing detection efficiency or enhancing large angular acceptance. Notable new detection systems such as STRASSE, TOGAXI, HYPATIA, NEBULA(plus), and TRIP have been developed at the RIBF to meet these demands. As high-intensity RI beams become available worldwide, we reflect on past detectors and provide a review of the future development of detection devices.},

The characteristic features of this reaction and the experimental challenges and advantages of inverse-kinematics experiments are summarized. The applicability to radioactive beams opens a large research potential to study a variety of properties of neutron-to-proton asymmetric nuclei. Applications of quasi-free scattering in inverse kinematics and its potential are reviewed based on recent and ongoing research programs at different accelerator facilities worldwide.},

NeuLAND detects neutrons with energies from 100 to 1000 MeV, featuring a high detection efficiency, a high spatial and time resolution, and a large multi-neutron reconstruction efficiency. This is achieved by a highly granular design of organic scintillators: 3000 individual submodules with a size of 5 × 5 × 250 cm3 are arranged in 30 double planes with 100 submodules each, providing an active area of 250 × 250 cm2 and a total depth of 3 m. The spatial resolution due to the granularity together with a time resolution of 𝜎𝑡 ≤ 150 ps ensures highresolution capabilities. In conjunction with calorimetric properties, a multi-neutron reconstruction efficiency of 50\% to 70\% for four-neutron events will be achieved, depending on both the emission scenario and the boundary conditions allowed for the reconstruction method. We present in this paper the final design of the detector as well as results from test measurements and simulations on which this design is based.},

Among the various detection systems, one of the most recent upgrades consists of the installation of a large area, around 2 m2, multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC). The chamber is equipped with twelve 0.3 mm gaps and readout by 30 mm pitch strips, exhibiting a timing precision down to 50 ps and efficiencies above 98\% for minimum ionizing particles in a previous characterization of the detector. The RPC was part of the setup of the FAIR Phase 0 experiment that focused on measuring for the first time, in spring 2022, nucleon–nucleon short-range correlations (SRC) inside an exotic nucleus (16C). The excellent timing precision of this detector will allow the measurement of the forward emitted proton momentum with a resolution of around 1\%. In beam measurements show an RPC efficiency above 95\% and a time precision better than 100 ps (including the contribution of a reference scintillator and the momentum spread of the particles) for forward emitted particles.},

The FAIR accelerator complex constitutes a substantial extension of the present GSI systems and will use the existing accelerators after several upgrades as an injector. This new facility comprises as an integral part a nextgeneration rare-isotope beam facility based on the production and separation of secondary beams produced by fragmentation or ﬁssion of energetic high-intensity primary ion beams. An advanced experimental program including new and unique concepts promises a new quality in investigations of nuclei far away from stability. A brief overview on the facility is presented with emphasis on the radioactive-beam facility. The experimental program and its related instrumentation is discussed brieﬂy.},

	abstract = {The FAIR facility, under construction at the GSI site in Darmstadt, will be addressing a wealth of outstanding questions within the realm of subatomic, atomic, plasma, bio-physics and applications through a combination of novel accelerators, storage rings and innovative experimental set-ups. One of the key installations is the fragment separator Super-FRS that will be able to deliver an unprecedented range of radioactive ion beams in the energy range of 0–1.5 GeV u−1. These beams will be distributed to three branches, each with its unique domain with respect to beam energies and properties. The high-energy branch will permit reactions with radioactive beams at relativistic energies, whereas the low-energy branch will supply decelerated beams for high-resolution spectroscopy, traps and laser spectroscopy. Finally, the ring branch will uniquely permit stored and cooled exotic beams for a range of methods only possible in a storage ring. Thus, by developing experimental set-ups tailored for these beams, there are several complementary possibilities to gain information on key nuclei and reaction, to further our understanding on contemporary questions within nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. This ambitious programme is to be exploited within the nuclear structure, astrophysics and reactions collaboration.},

Its unique design is dedicated to the acceleration of intermediate charge state heavy ions. Several new technical approaches assure the stabilization of the vacuum dynamics and the minimization of charge related beam loss. Beside high intensity heavy ions, SIS100 will accelerate all ions from Protons to Uranium, and in spite of the fact that superconducting magnets are used, SIS100 shall be as ﬂexible in ramping and cycling as a normal conducting synchrotron.},

The PANDA scientiﬁc program will address a wide range of topics, all aiming at improving our understanding of the strong interaction and hadron structure. The PANDA detector is a general-purpose spectrometer that will collect high quality and high statistics data in the ﬁelds of meson spectroscopy, baryon-antibaryon production, baryon spectroscopy, hypernuclear physics, hadron properties in the nuclear medium, and nucleon structure. This paper reviews some of the main physics topics of the experiment, together with a presentation of the detector.},

	The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is one of the major scientific pillars of the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). The physics programme of CBM is centred around the exploration of the QCD phase diagram and nuclear matter equation-of-state in the region of high baryon densities. The respective rare probes will be accessed by using nucleus-nucleus collisions in the energy range √s

It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language.
