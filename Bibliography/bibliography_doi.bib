	abstract = {Quasi-free scattering of atomic nuclei away from the stability line has reached several milestones over the past decade. The advent of gamma, charged-particle, and neutron detection devices for inverse kinematics, especially in combination with RI beams, has opened new horizons in nuclear physics. Research is progressing with detection devices optimized to explore these new and challenging areas of physics. While some of the new detection developments aim for high energy and angular resolution, others focus on increasing detection efficiency or enhancing large angular acceptance. Notable new detection systems such as STRASSE, TOGAXI, HYPATIA, NEBULA(plus), and TRIP have been developed at the RIBF to meet these demands. As high-intensity RI beams become available worldwide, we reflect on past detectors and provide a review of the future development of detection devices.},

NeuLAND detects neutrons with energies from 100 to 1000 MeV, featuring a high detection efficiency, a high spatial and time resolution, and a large multi-neutron reconstruction efficiency. This is achieved by a highly granular design of organic scintillators: 3000 individual submodules with a size of 5 × 5 × 250 cm3 are arranged in 30 double planes with 100 submodules each, providing an active area of 250 × 250 cm2 and a total depth of 3 m. The spatial resolution due to the granularity together with a time resolution of 𝜎𝑡 ≤ 150 ps ensures highresolution capabilities. In conjunction with calorimetric properties, a multi-neutron reconstruction efficiency of 50\% to 70\% for four-neutron events will be achieved, depending on both the emission scenario and the boundary conditions allowed for the reconstruction method. We present in this paper the final design of the detector as well as results from test measurements and simulations on which this design is based.},

Among the various detection systems, one of the most recent upgrades consists of the installation of a large area, around 2 m2, multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC). The chamber is equipped with twelve 0.3 mm gaps and readout by 30 mm pitch strips, exhibiting a timing precision down to 50 ps and efficiencies above 98\% for minimum ionizing particles in a previous characterization of the detector. The RPC was part of the setup of the FAIR Phase 0 experiment that focused on measuring for the first time, in spring 2022, nucleon–nucleon short-range correlations (SRC) inside an exotic nucleus (16C). The excellent timing precision of this detector will allow the measurement of the forward emitted proton momentum with a resolution of around 1\%. In beam measurements show an RPC efficiency above 95\% and a time precision better than 100 ps (including the contribution of a reference scintillator and the momentum spread of the particles) for forward emitted particles.},

	abstract = {In the search for alternatives to chlorine-containing gases, tetraﬂuoroethane, CF3CH2F (R134a), a widely used refrigerant gas, has been recognized as a promising substitute for dichlorodiﬂuoromethane, CCl2F2 (R12). When R12 is replaced by R134a, the global warming potential drops from 8100 to 1430, the ozone depletion potential changes from 1 to 0, and the atmospheric lifetime decreases from 100 to 14 years. Electron interactions in the gas phase play a fundamental role in the atmospheric sciences. Here, we present a detailed study on electron-driven fragmentation pathways of CF3CH2F, in which we have investigated processes induced by both electron ionization and electron attachment. The measurements allow us to report the ion eﬃciency curves for ion formation in the energy range of 0 up to 25 eV. For positive ion formation, R134a dissociates into a wide assortment of ions, in which CF3+ is observed as the most abundant out of seven ions with a relative intensity above 2\%. The results are supported by quantum chemical calculations based on bound state techniques, electron-impact ionization models, and electron-molecule scattering simulations, showing a good agreement. Moreover, the experimental ﬁrst ionization potential was found at 13.10 ± 0.17 eV and the second at around 14.25 eV. For negative ion formation, C2F3− was detected as the only anion formed, above 8.3 eV. This study demonstrates the role of electrons in the dissociation of R134a, which is relevant for an improvement of the refrigeration processes as well as in atmospheric chemistry and plasma sciences.},

The FAIR accelerator complex constitutes a substantial extension of the present GSI systems and will use the existing accelerators after several upgrades as an injector. This new facility comprises as an integral part a nextgeneration rare-isotope beam facility based on the production and separation of secondary beams produced by fragmentation or ﬁssion of energetic high-intensity primary ion beams. An advanced experimental program including new and unique concepts promises a new quality in investigations of nuclei far away from stability. A brief overview on the facility is presented with emphasis on the radioactive-beam facility. The experimental program and its related instrumentation is discussed brieﬂy.},

	abstract = {The FAIR facility, under construction at the GSI site in Darmstadt, will be addressing a wealth of outstanding questions within the realm of subatomic, atomic, plasma, bio-physics and applications through a combination of novel accelerators, storage rings and innovative experimental set-ups. One of the key installations is the fragment separator Super-FRS that will be able to deliver an unprecedented range of radioactive ion beams in the energy range of 0–1.5 GeV u−1. These beams will be distributed to three branches, each with its unique domain with respect to beam energies and properties. The high-energy branch will permit reactions with radioactive beams at relativistic energies, whereas the low-energy branch will supply decelerated beams for high-resolution spectroscopy, traps and laser spectroscopy. Finally, the ring branch will uniquely permit stored and cooled exotic beams for a range of methods only possible in a storage ring. Thus, by developing experimental set-ups tailored for these beams, there are several complementary possibilities to gain information on key nuclei and reaction, to further our understanding on contemporary questions within nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. This ambitious programme is to be exploited within the nuclear structure, astrophysics and reactions collaboration.},

The framework delivers base classes which enable the users to easily construct their experimental setup in a fast and convenient way. By using the Virtual Monte Carlo concept it is possible to perform the simulations using either Geant3 or Geant4 without changing the user code or the geometry description. Using and extending the task mechanism of ROOT it is possible to implement complex analysis tasks in a convenient way. Moreover, using the FairCuda interface of the framework it is possible to run some of these tasks also on GPU. Data IO, as well as parameter handling and data base connections are also handled by the framework. Since some of the experiments will not have an experimental setup with a conventional trigger system, the framework can handle also free ﬂowing input streams of detector data. For this mode of operation the framework provides classes to create the needed time sorted input streams of detector data out of the event based simulation data . There are also tools to do radiation studies and to visualize the simulated data. A CMake-CDash based building and monitoring system is also part of the FairRoot services which helps to build and test the framework on many diﬀerent platforms in an automatic way, including also Continuous Integration.},

	A long-standing question in nuclear physics is whether chargeless nuclear systems can exist. To our knowledge, only neutron stars represent near-pure neutron systems, where neutrons are squeezed together by the gravitational force to very high densities. The experimental search for isolated multi-neutron systems has been an ongoing quest for several decades
	1
	, with a particular focus on the four-neutron system called the tetraneutron, resulting in only a few indications of its existence so far
	2–4
	, leaving the tetraneutron an elusive nuclear system for six decades. Here we report on the observation of a resonance-like structure near threshold in the four-neutron system that is consistent with a quasi-bound tetraneutron state existing for a very short time. The measured energy and width of this state provide a key benchmark for our understanding of the nuclear force. The use of an experimental approach based on a knockout reaction at large momentum transfer with a radioactive high-energy

The reference heavy ion for future FAIR-operation is uranium, with highest intensity requirements. To re-establish uranium beam operation and to improve high current beam operation, different subjects have been explored in dedicated machine investigation campaigns. After a beam line modification in 2017 the RFQ-performance had deteriorated significantly; new rods have been installed and the RF-working point has been redefined. Also the Superlensperformance had become unsatisfactory; improved with a modified RF-coupler. With a pulsed hydrogen gas stripper target the uranium beam stripping efficiency could be increased by 65\%. Various work has already been carried out to establish this stripper device in routine operation. With medium heavy ion beams a very high beam brilliance at the end of transfer line to SIS18 was achieved. Results of the measurement campaigns and the UNILAC upgrade activities will be presented.},

The ALPIDE design takes full advantage of a particular process feature, the deep p-well, which allows for full CMOS circuitry within the pixel matrix, while at the same time retaining the full charge collection efﬁciency. Together with the small feature size and the availability of six metal layers, this allowed a continuously active low-power front-end to be placed into each pixel and an in-matrix sparsiﬁcation circuit to be used that sends only the addresses of hit pixels to the periphery. This approach led to a power consumption of less than 40 mW cm 2, a spatial resolution of around 5 μm, a peaking time of around 2 μs, while being radiation hard to some 1013 1 MeV neq=cm2, fulﬁlling or exceeding the ALICE requirements.},

	abstract = {SHiP (Search for Hidden Particles) is a general-purpose experiment to be installed in a new beam-dump facility at the SPS at CERN to search for hidden particles as predicted by a very large number of recently elaborated models. The proposed experimental apparatus contains, among others, a 50 m2 Timing Detector, crucial to reject the combinatorial background, with a requirement of a timing precision better than 100 ps together with the highest possible detection eﬃciency. One possibility for the construction of the Timing Detector is the Multigap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) technology. In this paper, we report the design and test beam results of the ﬁrst full-scale module, based on a novel concept on the construction of MRPCs, where the glass stack and high-voltage electrodes are conﬁned within a permanently sealed plastic box, exhibiting a time precision of 54 ps together with a detection eﬃciency of 98\% over almost 2 m2 of active area.},

	abstract = {Over the last 3 years we investigated theoretical aspects of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) in order to clarify some of the outstanding questions on space charge effects, high efﬁciency of small gap RPCs, charge spectra, signal shape and time resolution. In a series of reports we analyzed RPC performance including all detector aspects covering primary ionization, avalanche multiplication, space charge effects, signal induction in presence of resistive materials, crosstalk along detectors with long strips and front-end electronics. Using detector gas parameters entirely based on theoretical predictions and physical models for avalanche development and space charge effects we are able to reproduce measurements for 2 and 0:3 mm RPCs to very high accuracy without any additional assumptions. This fact gives a profound insight into the workings of RPCs and also underlines the striking difference in operation regime when compared to wire chambers. A summary of this work as well as recent results on three-dimensional electric ﬁeld distributions inside the avalanches are presented.},
